## Using conjur-oss-helm-chart with Conjur Open Source 

See [./conjur-oss](conjur-oss) for Chart files and instructions.

We **strongly** recommend choosing the version of this project to use from the latest [Conjur OSS 
suite release](https://docs.conjur.org/Latest/en/Content/Overview/Conjur-OSS-Suite-Overview.html). 
Conjur maintainers perform additional testing on the suite release versions to ensure 
compatibility. When possible, upgrade your Conjur version to match the 
[latest suite release](https://docs.conjur.org/Latest/en/Content/ReleaseNotes/ConjurOSS-suite-RN.htm); 
when using integrations, choose the latest suite release that matches your Conjur version. For any 
questions, please contact us on [Discourse](https://discuss.cyberarkcommons.org/c/conjur/5).


## Requirements

This chart requires Helm v3+. The chart may work with older versions of Helm
but that deployment isn't specifically supported.

This repository includes basic smoke testing on GKE.
